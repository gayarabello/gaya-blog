  "body": "10 years ago I chose to study Advertisement instead of Graphic Design at college. First, because I wanted to understand people and their motivations so I could create ads that effectively communicated with their aspirations and needs. Second, because I never trusted my free hand skills. üëã\n\nThe next 10 years I passed regretting I didn‚Äôt study Graphic Design at college. I felt really hard the lack of color theory, typography, geometry, and all the universe that design embraces.\n\nI managed, with the help of my designer sister and mother, google, youtube, books, friends, and a lot of observation, to learn (what I find) the basics of visual design and started working with Art Direction.\n\nI started in a small printing bureau, designing logos, brochures, and business cards. One thing leads to another, a client that needs a logo, needs also sales material, and maybe‚Ä¶ why not‚Ä¶ a website?\n\nI know it sounds pretty lame, but creating websites in WIX for those clients was my first experience designing digital products.\n\nFive years later, here I am, sitting in[UPTEC](https://uptec.up.pt/pt-pt/), taking a postgraduate degree at Porto University in*Interaction Design: web and games*and working as an intern for one of the Web Summit‚Äôs favorites startups of 2018.\n\nWhat lead me here? I found out that I love design as much as I love people.\n\nFrom today on, I‚Äôll share with you my experience as an everyday UX student.\n\n### üëç\n\nThanks for joining!"
