Because of that, I’ve been studying about productivity so I can to do things in a more efficient way and feel better by doing that.\n\nI resumed a few strategies I learned so far, and that I hope will help you too!\n\n* **1- Imposter Syndrome**😎\n\nSo you study about something, and you work hard on it, then you go on Linkedin, Dribbble, Behance, whatever professional network and you see successful people, with curious job titles, genius works of art, and neat interfaces and you’re like: who am I? Why There are a trizilion people better than me!\n\nShhhhhhhhh! Shut up, head!\n\nYes, there are a trizilion people better than you in a thousand things. But you, darling, you’re the one in charge. Get your challenge, and make the best of yourself. Make***tomorrow you***proud of your***today’s you***.\n\nEmbrace the opportunity you have to grow. Don’t hide yourself in any kind of “I aint good”. Yes, you are good, but you can always be better.\n\nKeep walking, keep growing. See other people’s work, try to understand what they did good. What is that that you admire so much, learn from it, phagocyte it and grow, go, go ahead!\n\n*Goldentip: face your smallness, believe in your unlimited growing power.*\n\n\n\n* **2-Drink Water! | fill yourself**🌊\n\nJust because your body is 70% water, do yourself a favor and fulfill yourself. If you feel empty inside there are 70% chances it’s lack of water.\n\n*Goldentip: get a 1,5l bottle and drink it all everyday, at least.*\n\n* **3- Exercise | sweat the hell of your stress out**🔥\n\nDoesn’t matter if you want to get in shape or not. Exercise so your brain will work decently. Sweat the hell of your stress out and your brain will be thankful.\n\n*Goldentip: do it right away in the morning, get rid of it, because in the end of the day you’ll have a bunch of excuses not to do it.*\n\n* **4-Breath | simple as that.**💨\n\nYou can do yoga, meditate or do any other mystic shit, or just pay attention to the way you breath. You need oxygen to think. Simple as that.\n\n*Goldentip: take deep long breaths and set alarms or use these zen apps.*\n\n* **5- Endgame | Spoiler alert**😵\n\nRemember the REAL end game. No, the endgame is not the deliver to your client, the endgame is not your boss’ happiness. The endgame is not even your salary.**The endgame is that life is short and one day you’re gonna die.**\n\n*Goldentip: Try not to take that in a irresponsible hedonist way. What I mean is that your motive can’t be just your paycheck**because that’s depressing.**Beyond my paychecks, I have 2 big motives: freetime under the sun and learning.*\n\n1. I want to work in a efficient and effective way so I can earn more money in less time and have more freetime to be under the sun. (Life quality in general, time to exercise, to travel, to be with my wife, to have time to prepare healthy meals…All these things that will feed my brain in a feedback loop and make me more productive)\n2. I want to work with things that will challenge me to learn more so I use my lifetime in a fulfilling way.\n\n\n\n* **6- Priorities**🏁\n\nThe importance of fighting toxic anxiety is that it takes your ability of defining priorities. When you don’t have a crystal clear priorities set, you tend to procrastinate. There are some time management techniques that might help you with that.\n\n*Goldentip: State objectives, trace priorities and bring them to your schedule.*\n\n* **7- Time blocking**⏰\n\nI try to define blocks of time in my day to do some important tasks. This way, whenever these tasks come to my head when I’m doing something else, I remember that there is already a schedule for that in my day, so I don’t lose focus of what I’m doing right now.\n\n*Goldentip: schedule important tasks and don’t overbook your day.*\n\n\n\n* **8- Be mindful**🛎️\n\nI’m not talking about zen hoopiewoofie peaceful song meditation blablabla. I’m talking about being focused on what you’re doing. If you’re on leisure time, be on leisure time. Organize yourself so you don’t feel like you should be doing anything else like working. If you’re working on something, be there, entirely, dive in. If you’re with your family, be there, look at them, hug them, put your phone away.\n\n*Goldentip: Don’t check you email/whatapp/whaterverisinyourphone before you have breakfast. Actually, try to check your email only when you’re able to resolve or respond whatever is in there.*\n\n* **9- SuperBusy**🗓️\n\nI know it’s superglamourous to have a busy schedule. But don’t be busy just to be busy and feel like you have full days. Busy yourself with things aligned with your real endgames. I know we can’t always do what we want, but keep it in mind and try to fill your days with things that will take you where you want to go. If you’re trying to go ahead, it doesn’t matter how many steps you give to the side…They can make your legs stronger, but they won’t take you anywhere.\n\n*Goldentip: Break your mid/long term objectives into small tasks and make them part of your routine.*\n\n* **10- Goals**📃\n\nPut your goals into paper with the day you wrote and the day you want to have them all accomplished. Go back to that paper, once a week.\n\n*Goldentip: check if your days are aligned with your goals and recalculate route if necessary.*\n\n* **11- Food**🥝\n\nYour energy comes from what you eat. If you feed yourself with shitty food, guess what? You’ll feel shitty somehow.\n\n*Goldentip: I know how hard it can be to keep up with a diet, but try bringing fruits into your breakfast and vegetables into your dinner, that’s a good way to start.*\n\n🚨FINAL VERY IMPORTANT ALERT 🚨\n\n**Caffeine is a pact with the devil**😈\n\nCaffeine will not**give**you energy, it will**borrow**you energy for a while and later your body will pay expensive for that loan.\n\n*Goldentip: Try to substitute at least one of your coffee cups for tea or water. It is damm hard, I know, but you’ll feel better in the mid term.*\n\nIt will be fun to read this, few years from now,\n\nWell, I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nHave a nice life!\n\n![](https://gayaexperience.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/whatsapp-image-2019-05-30-at-22.05.44.jpeg)\n\nMe in Dubrovnik doing one of the things I like the most, right before writing this article."
